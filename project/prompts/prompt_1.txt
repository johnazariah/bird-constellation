Create a new Aspire-based .NET 9 solution called `Owlet`.

Projects:
1. `Owlet.Api` (ASP.NET Core minimal API + simple Razor page)
   - GET `/` → show HTML search page
   - GET `/search?q=...` → return JSON list of files
   - GET `/folders` → list watched folders
   - POST `/folders` → { "path": "C:\\Users\\me\\Documents" }
2. `Owlet.Indexer` (Generic Host project)
   - Hosted service that:
     - loads watched folders (from Owlet.Api via HTTP or shared library)
     - watches for file changes
     - on change, calls extractors and writes to index
3. `Owlet.Extractors` (class lib)
   - interfaces: `ITextExtractor`, `IImageExtractor`
   - implementations: Txt, Markdown, Pdf (stub), Image metadata
4. Use SQLite (via EF Core or direct) to store a table `Files`:
   - Id, Path, Name, Extension, Kind (doc|image|other), Content (nullable), Tags (nullable), ModifiedAt

User flow:
- Run Owlet.AppHost → starts Api + Indexer
- Open http://localhost:5001 → add folders → search

Keep code clean and well-commented so a non-nerd can follow the Api project.
